<!-- <p> A member of my design team and I were assigned to completely rebrand an organization called Projekt Gap that has community tournements for several games. Me and my team leader created several assets to be used during streams along with the rebrand.</p>

<p> I was assigned to create four different jersey mockups for the four different teams that were planning to have a meetup at an event and wanted to be in uniform.</p> -->
